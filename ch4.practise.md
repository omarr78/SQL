## Example 1
### At a weekend retreat, the entity type PERSON has three sub-types:
* CAMPER
* BIKER
* RUNNER

### Draw a separate EER diagram segment for each Of the following situations:

#### a. At a given time. a person must be exactly one of these subtypes

#### b. A person may or may not be one of these subtypes. However, a person who is one of these subtypes cannot at the same time be one of the other subtypes.

#### c. A person may or may not be one of these subtypes On the other hand. a person may be any two (or even three) of these subtypes at the same time.

#### d. At a given time. a person must be at least one of these subtypes.

## Example 2

#### A bank has three types Of accounts: checking. savings. and loan. Following are the attributes for each type of account 
* CHECKING: Acct_No, Date_Opened, Balance, _Service_ Charge
* SAVINGS: Acct_No, Date_Opened, Balance, _lnterestâ€”Rate
* LOAN: Acct_No, Date_Opened, Balance, Interest_Rate, payment
#### Assume that cach bank account must be a member Of exactly one of these subtypes. Using generalization, develop an EER model segment to represent this situation using the traditional EER notation,
